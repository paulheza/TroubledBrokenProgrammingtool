After completing the alt 1 project there are many things I would have changed, kept, and just not done. In my opinion my group worked well together, and we also had fun in the process. I initially found editing the HTML code the most difficult as I had basic knowledge of it. However, as we continued to work on the ALT, I got better at editing the code. Later I found getting the real time graphs very difficult to work as the lines would not show up. Despite that, after trial and error I got the lines to show up.  I also tried to change the loading screen for the website, however, it did not work and it almost broke the whole website. If I was to keep one thing it would be the group. We had excellent communication between us and understood our goals. I really enjoyed my time with my ALT 1 group. </p>

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed doing ALT1. In some templates which we used, the HTML code was difficult to understand, especially the CSS as we only had primary knowledge of it. I tried to display the live-Microbit graphs on another page using a button but for some reason the lines on the graph did not display correctly. For this reason, we simply used a screenshot of our graphs on the Graph page. My group, however, were very co-operative and helpful throughout the duration of the project and I would love to work with them again.  </p>

I personally found doing ALT 1 enjoyable, especially as there were templates available online. Time management wasn’t as difficult as expected, and having a group to support me during this time made this project a way more enjoyable experience. Deciphering what each line of HTML was doing was difficult as there were many. At some moments, it was also difficult manipulating the data, for example, looking for where a specific line is just to change a few words. On the contact us page, I failed to get the message section working. Despite that, I enjoyed exploring what I could do using HTML and I wouldn’t mind creating another website. </p>
